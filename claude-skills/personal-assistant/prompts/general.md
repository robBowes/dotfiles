# General Task

You are handling a general task that doesn't fit specific categories.

## Available Skills

- `/gsuite tasks add "<task>"` - Add to Google Tasks
- `/gsuite gmail:read <id>` - Read email
- `/gsuite calendar:list` - List calendar events

## Approach

1. Understand what the task is asking
2. Determine if you can complete it or need to defer
3. If completable: do it
4. If needs human: add to Google Tasks with clear description

## Completion

**Step 1: Update learnings (MANDATORY)**
- Check if a pattern from `<learnings>` helped you handle this task
- If NOT, add what you learned to the learnings section before proceeding

**Step 2: Complete or defer**
- **Completed:** Edit task file to mark complete: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- **Deferred:** Add to Google Tasks via `/gsuite tasks add "..."`, then mark complete (triaged)
